    CSS SIZING
    To change font size use font-size:90px or whatever in your element whose font size has to be changed.But if you change the font of your browser to very large then you will observe that the font size of the element remains same and does not increase. This is because it is static not dynamic. To make it dynamic we have two options, 1.% 2.em
    100%=16px=1em
    When we use em or % for font-size then the previous value gets inherited from the parent like for e.g. if the body had font-size =2 em and the h1 had 5.6 em then the h1 will have 2 em and then will have 5.6 em on top of that.
    Whereas if body had font-size 20px and h1 had 90px then finally h1 would have 90px only.If the body has font size in px and the h1 has in em then too there is inheritance.
    But if you dont want inheritance then use rem which is root em. This doesnt inherit the previous font-size
    Jis bhi container mein line height daalte hain uss ke content ke beech mein woh distance aa jata hai.line height by default is 1
    Float and clear
    To wrap a text around an image we can have the image to float left or right and the text will get wrapped around it accordingly in the same line.
    This can be done easily by float:left; in the image section.
    If you want a particular element to not get wrapped around the image then you can use clear to do this. If there is an image on the left which is wrapping our element the go in the section of that element and write clear:left and by doing this it prevents the left part of it to get filled.
